Title: Digitalization of Submission Ticket

Description:

We are creating an online web application which helps in managing submission tickets issued by the college.

Trying to make the process paperless and faster is the goal of the project.

Often the tickets are misplaced and a lot of time is wasted by both the students as well as the teachers in signing the tickets.

Time is of utmost importance at the time of submissions as the End of Semester and Practical Exams are around the corner.

As such this project will be helpful to the students as the time spent filling out the submission ticket can be utilised for preparation for the exams.

If implemented this project can not only save time but also money and resources.
